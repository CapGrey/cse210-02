# Hilo
In the hilo game, you guess if the next card will be higher or lower
than the previous card. If you are correct, you earn 100 points. Wrong 
and you lose 75. You start with 300 points. The game ends either when 
you say so or if you run out of points.

## Running the Game
---
You need to have Python 3.8.0 or newer installed and running. Open the root folder (cse210-02) in a terminal. To play the game, copy and paste the following command into the terminal:
```
python3 code\hilogame.py
```
If that fails, try:

```
py code\hilogame.py
```
